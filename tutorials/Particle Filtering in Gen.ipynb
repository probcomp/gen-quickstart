    "Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods such as particle filtering iteratively solve a *sequence of inference problems* using techniques based on importance sampling and in some cases MCMC. The solution to each problem in the sequence is represented as a collection of samples or *particles*. The particles for each problem are based on extending or adjusting the particles for the previous problem in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence of inference problems that are solved often arise naturally from observations that arrive incrementally, as in particle filtering. The problems can also be constructed instrumentally to facilitate inference, as in annealed importance sampling [3]. This tutorial shows how to use Gen to implement a particle filter for a tracking problem that uses \"rejuvenation\" MCMC moves. Specifically, we will address the \"bearings only tracking\" problem described in [4].\n",

This is because the built-in modeling DSL by default always performs an end-to-end execution of the generative function body whenever performing a trace update. This allows the built-in modeling DSL to be very flexible and to have a simple implementation, at the cost of performance. There are several ways of improving performance after one has a prototype written in the built-in modeling DSL. One of these is [Generative Function Combinators](https://probcomp.github.io/Gen/dev/ref/combinators/), which make the flow of information through the generative process more explicit to Gen, and enable asymptotically more efficient inference programs.\n",
