    "The reason for the quadratic scaling is that the running time of the call to `mh` inside this loop also grows in proportion to the number of data points. This is because the updates to a trace of a model written the generic built-in modeling language always involve re-running **the entire** model generative function.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it should be possible for the algorithm to scale linearly in the number of data points. Briefly, deciding whether to update a given `is_outlier` variable can be done without referencing the other data points. This is because each `is_outiler` variable is conditionally independent of the outlier variables and y-coordinates of the other data points, conditioned on the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make this conditional independence structure explicit using the [Map generative function combinator](https://probcomp.github.io/Gen/dev/ref/combinators/#Map-combinator-1). Combinators like map encapsulate common modeling patterns (e.g., a loop in which each iteration is making independent choices), and when you use them, Gen can take advantage of the restrictions they enforce to implement performance optimizations automatically during inference. The `Map` combinator, like the `map` function in a functional programming language, helps to execute the same generative code repeatedly. "
