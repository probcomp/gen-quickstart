First, we want not only to estimate the slope and intercept of the line that best fits the data, but also to classify each point as an inlier or outlier; that is, there are a large number of latent variables of interest, enough to make importance sampling an unreliable method (absent a more involved custom proposal that does the heavy lifting). Second, several of the parameters we're estimating (the slope and intercept) are continuous and amenable to gradient-based search techniques, which will allow us to explore Gen's optimization capabilities.\n",

    "The general shape of an MCMC algorithm is as follows. We begin by sampling an intial setting of all unobserved variables; in Gen, we produce an initial _trace_ consistent with (but not necessarily _probable_ given) our observations. Then, in a long-running loop, we make small, stochastic changes to the trace; in order for the algorithm to be asymptotically correct, these stochastic updates must satisfy certain probabilistic properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "One common way of ensuring that the updates do satisfy those properties is to compute a _Metropolis-Hastings acceptance ratio_. Essentially, after proposing a change to a trace, we add an \"accept or reject\" step that stochastically decides whether to commit the update or to revert it. This is an over-simplification, but generally speaking, this step ensures we are more likely to accept changes that make our trace fit the observed data better, and to reject ones that make our current trace worse. The algorithm also tries not to go down dead ends: it is more likely to take an exploratory step into a low-probability region if it knows it can easily get back to where it came from.\n",

Using MCMC, there might be a borderline point that is sometimes classified as an outlier and sometimes not, reflecting our uncertainty; with MAP optimization, we will always be shown the most probable answer."
